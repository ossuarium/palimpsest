module Palimpsest

  # Use this class to store parts of your project in a location
  # separate from the normal installed location.
  #
  # For example, put custom templates in `components/my_app/templates`
  # which might later be installed to `apps/my_app/templates`.
  #
  # This is useful when `apps/my_app` is a separate project
  # with its own repository loaded using {Palimpsest::External}.
